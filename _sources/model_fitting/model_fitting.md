# Model Fitting

Chemistry is fundamentally a quantitative science, and our ability to understand chemical systems depends on more than just collecting experimental data. To develop and test theories, make predictions, and gain deeper insights, we need to understand the relationships between different chemical variables. This understanding often comes through building mathematical models that describe how these variables relate to each other.
