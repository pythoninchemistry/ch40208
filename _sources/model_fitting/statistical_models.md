## Statistical Models: Turing Data into Understanding

Statistical models provide a formal way to represent relationships between variables. When working with experimental or computational data, we typically have:

- A set of independent variables ($x$)
- A set of dependent variables ($y$)
- A proposed relationship between them: $y = f(x)$

## Choosing a Model

When selecting a model, you have two main approaches:

1. Empirical Models: Based on direct observation of the data
- Look at the data and choose a function that seems to fit the pattern
- No underlying theoretical justification needed
- Example: Fitting a polynomial of appropriate degree

2. Theoretical Models: Based on underlying physical principles
  - Derived from chemical/physical theory
  - Parameters have physical meaning
  - Example: Arrhenius equation for reaction rates

### The Principle of Simplicity (Occam's Razor)
In general, it is preferable to prefer simpler models over more complex models, unless there is good reason to use a more complex one. This helps avoid overfitting.
