    "## 1. Linear fitting of the Van't Hoff equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Van’t Hoff equation relates the change in the equilibrium constant, $K$, for a reaction, to a change in temperature, $T$, given that the enthalpy change for the reaction, $\\Delta H$, is constant over the temperature range of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\ln K}{\\mathrm{d} T} = \\frac{\\Delta H}{RT^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation is derived from two standard expressions for the Gibbs free energy change for a reaction:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T \\Delta S$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta G = -RT \\ln K$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining these two equations gives the linear form of the Van't Hoff equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ln K = -\\frac{\\Delta H}{RT} + \\frac{\\Delta S}{R}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Differentiating with respect to $1/T$ (keeping $\\Delta H$ and $\\Delta S$ constant) gives the derivative form of the Van't Hoff equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The linear form of the Van't Hoff equation has the functional form of the equation for a straight line (hence &ldquo;linear form&rdquo;)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = mx + c$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotting experimental data as $\\ln K$ against $1/T$ should, therefore, give an approximate straight line (as long as the enthalpy and entropy of reaction are approximately constant over the temperature range of interest). By fitting a straight line to these data, we can obtain &ldquo;best fit&rdquo; values for the slope and intercept, which correspond to $\\Delta H/R$ and to $\\Delta S/R$ in our model. By fitting to data we can, therefore, estimate $\\Delta H$ and $\\Delta S$ for a given reaction."

    "\n",
    "Compare the fitted parameters from the linearised fit with those from the non-linear fit. You should find they are slightly different. The non-linear fit (fitting the exponential model directly) is generally preferred and gives more accurate parameter estimates. The linearised fit is more numerically stable with respect to the starting guess though, so is useful primarily as a way to obtain good initial guesses for the non-linear fit."
