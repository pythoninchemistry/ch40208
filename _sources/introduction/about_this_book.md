# About this Book

This is the course "book" for *CH40208 Topics in Computational Chemistry* at the University of Bath, taught by [Benjamin Morgan](mailto:b.j.morgan@bath.ac.uk) and [Fiona Dickinson](mailto:f.dickinson@bath.ac.uk). 

The first version of this material was written by Benjamin Morgan and Andrew McCluskey in 2020 as a flipped learning resource for online teaching. 

Since then, the course book has expanded into a digital textbook, based around the current CH40208 programme.
