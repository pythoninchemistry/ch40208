# Course Structure

The aim of this course is to offer a *taster* of some practical computational chemistry techniques. 
However, before this, it is necessary to develop the skills to handle these techniques, and the most important skill for a modern computational chemistry is **programming**. 
Therefore, the structure of this course is well represented with the following figure.

*What you can expect to be learning over time.*

In additional to being and important skill, learning to program will also help in other ways:
- you will be more capable of understanding **what** the computer is doing and **why**, 
- you will learn how to deconstruct a problem into it's constituent parts and build an *algorithm* from these, 
- programming is generally a useful skill to have (both in chemistry and outside)

We will be introducing the Python from the basics (so you won't need to remember the Python labs in years 1 and 2), and equip you with the tools to tackle *real* chemical problems computationally.
