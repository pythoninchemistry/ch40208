# NumPy

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. NumPy provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a vast collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.

Using NumPy makes working with numerical data much easier and quicker than performing the same operations using only the Python standard library (e.g., storing and manipulating data using lists).
