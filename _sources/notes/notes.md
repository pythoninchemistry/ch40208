- Possible more scaffolding for the "interatomic distances using nested loops" exercise -> can we build this so that students have already thought about the issues of efficiently computing all r_ij -> what problem are we trying to solve by using a nested loop? This is an opportunity to actually talk about what problem we are trying to solve in the context of computational chemistry.
