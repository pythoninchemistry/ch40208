    "# Logical Operations and Flow Control\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the code examples so far perform the same set of operations, in the same order, even if we change the input data. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of problems where it is helpful to have the computer perform **different** operations depending on the specific values of the input data. For example, we might want to write code that has the option of converting from Celsius to Kelvin, or we might want to check our data after we have read it in for any unphysical values&mdash;for example, negative temperatures&mdash;and raise a warning or automatically exclude the offending data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides **control statements** that allow us to choose the order of execution of our code depending on the value of a **logical expression**. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most useful **control statements** is the `if` statement, which allows us to run a particular piece of code **if** an **expression** is **true**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A non-programming example might be:\n",
    "\n",
    "> If today is Monday or Friday then I will log on to the CH40208 LOIL at 10:15 am.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here our **expression** we consider is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> today is Monday or Friday\n",
    "\n",
    "If this **expression** is **true** then we perform an action.\n",
    "\n",
    "> I will log on to the CH40208 LOIL at 10:15 am.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this **expression** is **false** (and it is **not** Monday or Friday) we can skip the action and move onto the next thing in our day.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could make this explicit by defining what we will do if the **expression** is **false**:\n",
    "\n",
    "> If today is Monday of Friday then I will log on to the CH40208 LOIL at 10:15 am. Otherwise, I will read my notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have two possible actions. One that we do if the **expression** is **true**, and one that we do if the **expression** is **false**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we will see how to use `if` statements to construct similar **conditional** statements in our code. But first we need to look in a bit more detail into how Python decides if something is **true** or **false**."
