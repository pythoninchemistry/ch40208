    "**2. Easier to modify:**\n",
    "- If we want to change the convergence criterion (e.g., use absolute value, or a percentage-based threshold), we only need to update it in one place\n",
    "- Without a function, we'd need to find and update every occurrence\n",

    "**3. More readable:**\n",

    "- The calculation `temperature - room_temperature <= threshold` requires mental parsing to understand\n",

    "- We can test the convergence function independently with different inputs\n",
