# Week 2 Worked Examples

Worked solutions for Week 2 exercises:

- [Functions](week_2_functions.ipynb)

**How to use these worked examples:**
- Try each exercise yourself first before looking at the solution
- Each notebook corresponds to exercises from a specific course page
- Download the notebooks to run the code yourself and experiment
- Your solution might look different - that's fine as long as it gives the correct answer!

**Note:** Not all course pages have exercises. These worked examples cover the pages that include practice problems.
