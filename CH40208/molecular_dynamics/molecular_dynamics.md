# Molecular Dynamics

We have previously looked at the idea of predicting equilibrium geometries of molecules or materials using [geometry optimisation](sec:geometry-optimisation). For geometry optimisation we use calculations of potential energy as a function of atomic coordinates to search for a set of atomic coordinates that **minimises** the total potential energy.

Geometry optimization effectively approximates structures at <i>T</i> = 0 K. But we are often interested in molecular properties at higher temperatures where thermal effects become important. At temperatures <i>T</i> > 0&nbsp;K, molecules are not static but are constantly in motion. To understand molecular properties we need a modelling approach that can describe these molecular motions.
