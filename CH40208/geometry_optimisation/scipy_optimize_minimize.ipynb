    "## Minimisation with `scipy.optimize.minimize`\n",
    "\n",
    "`scipy.optimize.minimize()` is a powerful tool for numerical optimisation that finds the minimum of any scalar function (a function that returns a single numerical value). Unlike the methods we have implemented so far, `scipy.optimize.minimize()` uses more sophisticated algorithms that automatically handle many of the challenges we have encountered, such as choosing appropriate step sizes and dealing with difficult potential energy surfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code demonstrates how `minimize()` can be used to find the minimum of a harmonic potential."

In this case, we need to define the shape of our harmonic potential energy surface by providing values for `k` and `r0`. Because our `harmonic_potential()` function takes two additional parameters, the tuple we pass to `minimize()` needs to contain two parameters.
