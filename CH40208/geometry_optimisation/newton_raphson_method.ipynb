    "## The Newton-Raphson Method\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative method for finding the minimum of a function is the Newton-Raphson Method (also called Newton's Method).\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight is that **at a minimum, the first derivative equals zero**: $f^\\prime(x) = 0$. So finding a minimum is equivalent to finding where the derivative vanishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Newton-Raphson method uses the idea that if we zoom in on any function, we can approximate the local shape of that function as quadratic, i.e.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x) \\approx ax^2 + bx + c$$\n",
    "\n",
    "over some small range of $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $f(x)$ is approximately quadratic near our current position, then its first derivative is approximately **linear**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f^\\prime(x) \\approx 2ax + b$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we know the coefficients $a$ and $b$, we can directly solve for where this linear approximation crosses zero (i.e., where $f^\\prime(x) = 0$):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$2ax + b = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x = \\frac{-b}{2a}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us our predicted location of the minimum.\n"

    "To find the coefficients $a$ and $b$ of our local quadratic approximation, we use the property that any smooth function can be expanded as a **Taylor series** (see, e.g., Chapter 6 in [Foundations of Science Mathematics](https://bath.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44BAT_INST/iac705/alma991004175199902761)).\n",

    "This is the **Newton-Raphson equation**. Starting from our current position $x_0$, it predicts a new position $x$ that should be closer to the minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of finding the minimum of a potential energy surface, we can rewrite this using our usual notation for energy and bond length:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Starting at an initial guess $r_n$, calculate the first and second derivatives of $U(r_n)$ at that point.\n",
    "2. Use the Newton-Raphson equation to predict a new position:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r_{n+1} = r_n - \\frac{U^\\prime(r_n)}{U^{\\prime\\prime}(r_n)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, our potential energy surface is never exactly quadratic (except for the special case of a harmonic potential), so this equation only gives us an approximate guess for the minimum position. We therefore repeat steps 1 and 2 as an iterative process, recalculating the derivatives at each new position, until we (hopefully) converge on the energy minimum."
