    "## The Newton-Raphson Method\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative method for finding the minimum of a function is the Newton-Raphson Method (also called Newton's Method).\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight is that **at a minimum, the first derivative equals zero**: $f^\\prime(x) = 0$. So finding a minimum is equivalent to finding where the derivative vanishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Newton-Raphson method uses the idea that if we zoom in on any function, we can approximate the local shape of that function as quadratic, i.e.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x) \\approx ax^2 + bx + c$$\n",
    "\n",
    "over some small range of $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $f(x)$ is approximately quadratic near our current position, then its first derivative is approximately **linear**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f^\\prime(x) \\approx 2ax + b$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we know the coefficients $a$ and $b$, we can directly solve for where this linear approximation crosses zero (i.e., where $f^\\prime(x) = 0$):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$2ax + b = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x = \\frac{-b}{2a}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us our predicted location of the minimum.\n"

    "To find the coefficients $a$ and $b$ of our local quadratic approximation, we use the property that any smooth function can be expanded as a **Taylor series** (see, e.g., Chapter 6 in [Foundations of Science Mathematics](https://bath.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44BAT_INST/iac705/alma991004175199902761)).\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are at some point $x_0$, then we can approximate our function locally as a polynomial in $(x-x_0)$:\n",

    "$$f(x) = f(x_0) + f^\\prime(x_0)(x-x_0) + \\frac{1}{2}f^{\\prime\\prime}(x_0)(x-x_0)^2 + \\ldots$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we remain close to $x_0$, where the higher-order terms in $(x-x_0)$ are small, we can truncate this series after the quadratic term:\n",

    "This is our quadratic approximation. Differentiating this expression with respect to $x$ gives us the approximation for the first derivative:\n",

    "\n",
    "This is the **Newton-Raphson equation**. Starting from our current position $x_0$, it predicts a new position $x$ that should be closer to the minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of finding the minimum of a potential energy surface, we can rewrite this using our usual notation for energy and bond length:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Starting at an initial guess $r_n$, calculate the first and second derivatives of $U(r_n)$ at that point.\n",
    "2. Use the Newton-Raphson equation to predict a new position:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r_{n+1} = r_n - \\frac{U^\\prime(r_n)}{U^{\\prime\\prime}(r_n)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, our potential energy surface is never exactly quadratic (except for the special case of a harmonic potential), so this equation only gives us an approximate guess for the minimum position. We therefore repeat steps 1 and 2 as an iterative process, recalculating the derivatives at each new position, until we (hopefully) converge on the energy minimum."

    "### Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will explore how the Newton-Raphson method performs on a harmonic potential, where we know the analytical solution is $r = r_0 = 0.74$ Å.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 1: Define the second derivative**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a function to calculate the second derivative of a harmonic potential:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$U^{\\prime\\prime}(r) = k$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for a harmonic potential, the second derivative is simply the force constant $k$ and does not depend on $r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 2: Demonstrate one-step convergence**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write code to perform Newton-Raphson optimisation on your harmonic potential starting from $r = 1.0$ Å. Your code should:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Calculate $U'(r)$ and $U''(r)$ at the starting position\n",
    "   - Apply the Newton-Raphson equation once: $r_1 = r_0 - \\frac{U'(r_0)}{U''(r_0)}$\n",
    "   - Print both the starting position and the position after one step\n",
    "   - Compare the result to the analytical solution ($r_0 = 0.74$ Å)\n",
    "     \n",
    "3. Repeat this calculation for at least three different starting positions:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - $r = 0.5$ Å (starting below the minimum)\n",
    "   - $r = 1.0$ Å (starting above the minimum)  \n",
    "   - $r = 1.5$ Å (starting well above the minimum)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions to consider:**\n",
    "- Does each starting point converge to exactly $r = 0.74$ Å in one step?\n",
    "- Why does the Newton-Raphson method work perfectly for a harmonic potential? (Hint: Consider what happens when you substitute the derivatives of a quadratic function into the Newton-Raphson equation. The method assumes the function is locally quadratic—what happens when the function is *exactly* quadratic everywhere?)\n",
    "- Will this one-step convergence property hold for other potential energy functions like the Lennard-Jones potential? Why or why not?"
