    "\n",
    "You have been provided with an experimental pressure/volume isotherm for SF<sub>6</sub> at 298 K in the form of a [csv file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pythoninchemistry/ch12004/main/CH12004/lab_5/isotherm.csv).\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Read in the experimental data using `numpy` and plot the isotherm using `matplotlib`.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Assuming ideality, the isotherm should be well modelled by the ideal gas law:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p = v^{-1}RT,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p$ is the pressure, $v$ is the molar volume ($V / n$), $R$ is the gas constant and $T$ is the temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function to calculate the pressure with the ideal gas law and use this to model the SF$_{6}$ isotherm between $v=6.87 \\times 10^{-4}$ m<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>&minus;1</sup> and $v = 4.47 \\times 10^{-3}$ m<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>&minus;1</sup>. Plot your modelled isotherm against the experimental data.\n",

    "c) Non-ideality due to intermolecular interactions and other factors can be accounted for (in part) by the Van der Waals equation of state:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p = \\frac{RT}{v - b} - \\frac{a}{v^{2}},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p$ is the pressure, $R$ is the gas constant, $v$ is the molar volume and $a$ and $b$ are system dependent constants that describe the strength of the interactions and excluded volume effects respectively.\n",

    "Write a function to calculate the pressure with the Van der Waals equation and use this to model the SF$_{6}$ isotherm, with $a=7.857 \\times 10^{-1}$ m<sup>6</sup> Pa mol<sup>&minus;2</sup> and $b=8.79 \\times 10^{-5}$ m<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>&minus;1</sup> between $v=6.87 \\times 10^{-4}$ m<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>&minus;1</sup> and $v = 4.47 \\times 10^{-3}$ m<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>&minus;1</sup>. Plot your modelled isotherm and compare this against the idealised curve and the experimental data.\n",

    "The **mean activity** of ions in solution can be measured experimentally. You have been provided with the mean activity of Na$_{2}$SO$_{4}$ at $298\\,$K for a range of ionic strengths: [activity.dat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pythoninchemistry/ch12004/main/CH12004/lab_5/activity.dat)\n",

    "a) Use `matplotlib` to render a scatter plot of the mean activity as a function of the ionic strength $I$.\n",

    "\n",
    "c) There are several extensions of the Debye-Huckel limiting law that aim to improve its description of the mean activity outside of the dilute limit. One such extension is:\n",

    "$$\\ln\\gamma_{\\pm} = -|z_{+}z_{-}|\\frac{A\\sqrt{I}}{1 + Ba_{0}\\sqrt{I}},$$\n",

    "Using $B = 18.3$ and $a_{0} = 0.071$, plot the extended Debye-Huckel mean activity from $I = 0\\,$M to $I = 6\\,$M and compare this with the experimental values and the original Debye-Huckel limiting law."
