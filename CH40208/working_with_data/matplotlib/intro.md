# Matplotlib

When working with data in chemistry, you'll often need to visualise your results&mdash;whether that's plotting how concentration changes over time, comparing reaction rates under different conditions, or creating a calibration curve. Plots help you understand your data and communicate your findings clearly.

Matplotlib is Python's main plotting library. It gives you the tools to create professional-looking figures directly from your NumPy arrays, making it straightforward to go from raw data to publication-quality plots.
