# Week 3 Worked Examples

Worked solutions for Week 3 exercises covering working with data:

- [NumPy Exercises](week_3_numpy.ipynb)
- [Synoptic Exercises](week_3_synoptic_exercises.ipynb)

**How to use these worked examples:**
- Try each exercise yourself first before looking at the solution
- Each notebook corresponds to exercises from a specific course page
- Download the notebooks to run the code yourself and experiment
- Your solution might look different - that's fine as long as it gives the correct answer!

**Note:** The synoptic exercises combine concepts from NumPy, Matplotlib, and File I/O to solve more complex problems.
