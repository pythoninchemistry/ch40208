# Week 6 Worked Examples

This section contains model answers for the Week 6 exercises on model fitting.

The exercises cover:

- **Exercise 1: Linear fitting of the Van't Hoff equation** — Using `scipy.optimize.minimize()` to fit a linear model to thermodynamic data and extract $\Delta H$ and $\Delta S$ for a reaction.
- **Exercise 2: Non-linear fitting of kinetic data** — Fitting a first-order kinetic model to experimental data for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide.
