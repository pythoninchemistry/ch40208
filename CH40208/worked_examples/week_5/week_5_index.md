# Week 5 Worked Examples

Worked solutions for Week 5 geometry optimisation exercises:

- [Grid Search Method](grid_search_method.ipynb)
- [Gradient Descent Method](gradient_descent_method.ipynb)
- [Newton-Raphson Method](newton_raphson_method.ipynb)
- [Synoptic Exercise: Lennard-Jones Optimisation](Lennard_Jones_optimisation.ipynb)
- [scipy.optimize.minimize()](scipy_optimize_minimize.ipynb)

**How to use these worked examples:**
- Try each exercise yourself first before looking at the solution
- Each notebook corresponds to exercises from a specific course page
- Download the notebooks to run the code yourself and experiment
- Your solution might look different - that's fine as long as it gives the correct answer!
