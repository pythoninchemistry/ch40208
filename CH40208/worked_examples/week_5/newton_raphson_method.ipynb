    "The Newton-Raphson method **converges to the exact minimum in a single step**! Starting from $r = 1.0$ Å, we arrive at $r = 0.74$ Å after just one iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's understand why this happens. For the harmonic potential:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$U'(r) = k(r - r_0)$$\n",
    "$$U''(r) = k$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting into the Newton-Raphson equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r_{\\text{new}} = r_{\\text{old}} - \\frac{U'(r_{\\text{old}})}{U''(r_{\\text{old}})} = r_{\\text{old}} - \\frac{k(r_{\\text{old}} - r_0)}{k}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The $k$ terms cancel:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r_{\\text{new}} = r_{\\text{old}} - (r_{\\text{old}} - r_0) = r_0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So regardless of where we start, a single Newton-Raphson step takes us directly to $r_0$!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why does this work?** The Newton-Raphson method assumes the function is locally quadratic. For a harmonic potential, the function is **exactly quadratic everywhere**, so the \"local\" approximation is actually perfect globally. The method doesn't need iteration because its fundamental assumption is exactly satisfied."
