    "## 1. Linear fitting of the Van't Hoff equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Van’t Hoff equation relates the change in the equilibrium constant, $K$, for a reaction, to a change in temperature, $T$, given that the enthalpy change for the reaction, $\\Delta H$, is constant over the temperature range of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\ln K}{\\mathrm{d} T} = \\frac{\\Delta H}{RT^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation is derived from two standard expressions for the Gibbs free energy change for a reaction:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T \\Delta S$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta G = -RT \\ln K$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining these two equations gives the linear form of the Van't Hoff equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ln K = -\\frac{\\Delta H}{RT} + \\frac{\\Delta S}{R}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Differentiating with respect to $1/T$ (keeping $\\Delta H$ and $\\Delta S$ constant) gives the derivative form of the Van't Hoff equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The linear form of the Van't Hoff equation has the functional form of the equation for a straight line (hence &ldquo;linear form&rdquo;)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = mx + c$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotting experimental data as $\\ln K$ against $1/T$ should, therefore, give an approximate straight line (as long as the enthalpy and entropy of reaction are approximately constant over the temperature range of interest). By fitting a straight line to these data, we can obtain &ldquo;best fit&rdquo; values for the slope and intercept, which correspond to $\\Delta H/R$ and to $\\Delta S/R$ in our model. By fitting to data we can, therefore, estimate $\\Delta H$ and $\\Delta S$ for a given reaction."
