# Model Fitting

Chemistry is fundamentally a quantitative science, and a key skill is being able to describe relationships from experimental or computational data.
While collecting data is important, the real value often comes from our ability to interpret it and use it to make predictions about future experiments or refine our theoretical understanding of some chemical behaviour.

One of the key skills in computational chemistry is being able to extract meaningful relationships from experimental or computational data. While collecting data is important, the real value comes from our ability to interpret it and use it to make predictions about future experiments or refine our theoretical understanding.
